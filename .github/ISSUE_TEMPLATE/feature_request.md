**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of the pain point.  
Example: "It's hard to test role assignment because there's no built-in tool for assigning roles."

**Describe the solution you'd like**
What should the SDK do?  
Example: "A `assignRole` tool that lets the AI grant a role to a user."

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Other ways this could be solved.  
Example: "Manually writing Discord.js role assignment code instead of using a tool."

**Potential impact**
Why is this feature important for bot developers?  
Example: "Would make moderation tools AI-driven out of the box."

**Additional context**
Add any other context, screenshots, or links to relevant docs/discussions.
